Modernize
=========

Lib for permuting items in a wordlist & finding those permutations that match
a set of known words; used by me to modernize spelling of words with letters
that were interchangeable (u and v), undifferentiated (i for j), or were commonly 
abbreviated (ā, ē, ō -- vowels with macrons -- for am or an, em or en, etc.) in
early modern printing.

*Note that I refer to external libs not present here.*
